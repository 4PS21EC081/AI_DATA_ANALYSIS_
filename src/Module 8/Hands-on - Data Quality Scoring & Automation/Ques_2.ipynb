    "1. Objective: Determine the percentage of non-missing values in a dataset.\n",
    "2. Steps:\n",
    "    - Load a sample dataset using Pandas.\n",
    "    - Identify the columns with missing values.\n",
    "    - Calculate the completeness score as the ratio of non-missing values to total values.\n",

    "    - Choose a column expected to have consistent values.\n",
